        <p class="bold">Be a challenger</p>
        <p>In everything we do, challenge the norms. Be brave, drive for constant innovation. Push ourselves individually and collectively to achieve more, everyday.</p>
        <p class="bold">Create positive societal impact</p>
        <p>We will make money, however let's make sustainability the core of how we do it. Let's leave a positive legacy for Evolution.</p>
        <p class="bold">Act with integrity always</p>
        <p>Always feel empowered to be transparent with each other, our customers, our suppliers and everyone in our ecosystem.</p>
        <p class="bold">Enjoy the journey!</p>
        <p>Be a driver, not a passenger. Sitting in the back of the car you may have some great views, but you aren't in control of where we are heading.</p>

Darren founded Evolution because he believed that customers deserved a greater choice of sustainable data centre infrastructure in Asia.<br>
          <br>
          Darren has been in Asia for 10 years and he has worked in all aspects of the digital infrastructure ecosystem, including telco, data centre and artificial intelligence. Based in Singapore Darren was the MD for Asia for IO Data Centres (a next-generation, modular data centre operator), where he led the business to net cash flow positive and ultimately to a successful exit.<br>
          <br>
          With his co-founder, and leadership team, Darren is passionate about workplace culture. He aspires for Evolution to be a company where everyone makes an active contribution and is accountable. Darren's mantra is to enjoy the journey, rather than being obsessed with reaching the destination.Â <br>
          <br>
        Darren has a personal commitment to improving health and sustainability. He regularly walks 10km to the office and refuses to take any shop offered plastic bags.</p>
